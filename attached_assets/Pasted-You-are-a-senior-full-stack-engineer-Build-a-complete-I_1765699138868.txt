You are a senior full-stack engineer.
Build a complete Instagram-style Mini Clone using Python (Flask) for backend, MySQL for database, and React.js for frontend.

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS (Flask + MySQL + fastapi)

Post (id, user_id, image_url, caption, created_at)

Followers (follower_id, following_id)

Like (user_id, post_id)

Comment (id, user_id, post_id, content, created_at)

Enforce:

Unique likes per user per post

No duplicate follow relationships

4. Features & APIs

Ensure the app runs end-to-end successfully

Build clean, readable, production-style code with comments where necessary.
